**Team:** RADAR

**Topic** Trump vs Clinton: the 2016 Presidential election through their own words

We will evaluate this milestone according to how well these steps have been done and documented, the quality of the code and its documentation, the feasibility and critical awareness of the project. We will also evaluate this milestone according to how clear, reasonable and well thought-through the project idea is. Please use the second milestone to really check with us that everything is in order with your project (idea, feasibility, etc.) before you advance too much with the final Milestone 3! There will be project office hours dedicated to helping you.

# Trump vs Clinton: the 2016 Presidential election through their own words

## Abstract:

“I’ve just received a call from Secretary Clinton,” said Donald Trump late in the night of Nov 8, 2016. The result of the 58th Presidential election, an intense battle between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, remains a major upset around the world. But was it? What can be seen and understood from this election, using only quotes by these candidates in the media? This could give a glimpse into the running of a major democratic election system, and the importance that speech and its representations have in making citizens turn for one party or another. Media biases have deep implications in our lives, and have evolved to be more extreme in this noisy world. We will analyze how Trump and Clinton’s words quoted in media outlets relate to the polarization seen during the 2016 U.S. election.
